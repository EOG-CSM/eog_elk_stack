## Start the ELK containers

Change password to desired password in .env file.

```
$ cd path/to/cloned/repository
$ cd main_elk_compose
$ sudo docker-compose up -d
```

## Creating the user-list index, enrich policy, and ingest pipelines.  

The below script handles all of this. Just make sure the elastic username:password in the script is correct if you change it (Default is elastic:elasticpassword).

`python3 send_users.py <name of user_list file.json>`

## Start the filebeat container

### Create the API Key

In kibana (http://eogdata.mines.edu:5601), seach API key, and add an API key.  You can call it whatever you like, make sure it's not restricted. When you copy the API key, make sure it is in the Beats format, not Base64. Copy the API key to the `filebeat/filebeat.yml` file in the field called `api_key` under `output.elasticsearch`. 

### Start the Container

```
$ cd path/to/cloned/repository
$ cd filebeat
$ sudo docker-compose up -d
```

Note: if this don't work, omit the `-d` to see what the container is printing to stdout.
